<p>I've been regularly hosting small conferences for over a decade, starting with the LAWST format and slowly evolving over the years. I just finished hosting the Watir Bazaar. I feel real good about it. One of the best conferences I've ever been to. Really excited: everyone had a good time, learned a lot, met a lot of new people, and shared stories about how people are really using Watir to kick ass.</p>
<p>We are wrapping up a release of Watir 4.0, which now uses Selenium technology called WebDriver to drive browsers. That means that Watir 4.0 will work with any browser that Selenium supports. Automatically. This is exciting. Equally exciting is the enthusiasm the community is showing for providing examples and showing others how you can make a testing framework for your application.</p>
<p>We will be documenting several approaches, including using TestUnit, Rspec and Cucumber, each of which has contexts where they become the preferred choices of the community.</p>
<p>Most of us are using page objects of one kind or another with a lot of success, to the point where we really think that everyone should know how to use them, and are working to share our ideas for how to create page objects no matter what kind of test harness you are using.</p>
